# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

You are an optimisation agent that supervises a thermal energy storage (TES) plant. Your job is to minimise cumulative CO₂ emissions over the full simulation horizon by planning TES charge and discharge decisions.
Developer instructions: respond using ASCII characters only. Return a single line formatted exactly as `[action_index]`, where action_index is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3}. Do not include additional text, explanations, markdown, or keys.

<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Objective:
- Minimise total CO₂ emissions = electricity consumption × time-varying CO₂ intensity over the horizon.

Current context:
- Current time [h]: 2025-05-05 08:00:00
- Current TES energy [kWh]: 150.0

Forecast data:
Forecast features (raw values aligned with the RL look-ahead):

- Remaining business hours today (08:00-17:00, close at 18:00):
  - 08:00: load=45.8 kW, co2=0.249 kg-CO2/kWh  ←Now!!!
  - 09:00: load=40.2 kW, co2=0.236 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 10:00: load=38.7 kW, co2=0.216 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 11:00: load=42.7 kW, co2=0.201 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 12:00: load=42.9 kW, co2=0.200 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 13:00: load=44.2 kW, co2=0.206 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 14:00: load=41.5 kW, co2=0.219 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 15:00: load=48.1 kW, co2=0.245 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 16:00: load=43.5 kW, co2=0.279 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 17:00: load=43.4 kW, co2=0.344 kg-CO2/kWh

- Next-day planning metrics (for terminal planning):
  - load_mean=33.3 kW (average cooling demand for next day)
  - co2_low5_avg=0.375 kg-CO2/kWh (average of lowest 5 hours of CO2 factor for next day)
  - co2_min=0.372 kg-CO2/kWh (minimum CO2 factor for next day)

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.

Return format:
- Output a single token formatted as `[action_index]` (e.g., `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`).<|end|><|start|>assistant",0,-10.124961437428992,-10.172279406700866,-10.216628104095658,-10.263946073367531,0.4401444601248761,0.2742179693661787,0.1759916102427309,0.1096459602662143

0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.

You are an optimisation agent that supervises a thermal energy storage (TES) plant. Your job is to minimise cumulative CO₂ emissions over the full simulation horizon by planning TES charge and discharge decisions.
Developer instructions: respond using ASCII characters only. Return a single line formatted exactly as `[action_index]`, where action_index is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3}. Do not include additional text, explanations, markdown, or keys.

<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Objective:
- Minimise total CO₂ emissions = electricity consumption × time-varying CO₂ intensity over the horizon.

Current context:
- Current time [h]: 2025-05-06 11:00:00
- Current TES energy [kWh]: 249.70373670182033

  - 17:00: load=16.7 kW, co2=0.388 kg-CO2/kWh

- Next-day planning metrics (for terminal planning):
  - load_mean=44.5 kW (average cooling demand for next day)
  - co2_low5_avg=0.212 kg-CO2/kWh (average of lowest 5 hours of CO2 factor for next day)
  - co2_min=0.200 kg-CO2/kWh (minimum CO2 factor for next day)

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.

You are an optimisation agent that supervises a thermal energy storage (TES) plant. Your job is to minimise cumulative CO₂ emissions over the full simulation horizon by planning TES charge and discharge decisions.
Developer instructions: respond using ASCII characters only. Return a single line formatted exactly as `[action_index]`, where action_index is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3}. Do not include additional text, explanations, markdown, or keys.

<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Objective:
- Minimise total CO₂ emissions = electricity consumption × time-varying CO₂ intensity over the horizon.

Current context:
- Current time [h]: 2025-05-07 14:00:00
- Current TES energy [kWh]: 253.6942371247607

  - 15:00: load=45.9 kW, co2=0.273 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 16:00: load=44.2 kW, co2=0.326 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 17:00: load=47.0 kW, co2=0.377 kg-CO2/kWh

- Next-day planning metrics (for terminal planning):
  - load_mean=35.7 kW (average cooling demand for next day)
  - co2_low5_avg=0.226 kg-CO2/kWh (average of lowest 5 hours of CO2 factor for next day)
  - co2_min=0.224 kg-CO2/kWh (minimum CO2 factor for next day)

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
