System parameters:

ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.

1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.

- Next-day planning metrics (for terminal planning):

  - co2_min=0.250 kg-CO2/kWh (minimum CO2 factor for next day)

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Leaving demand unmet causes a large penalty; only select low ASHP ratios when TES has enough energy to bridge the gap.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.
